### 🛡️ Security Considerations

#### Extension Security
- All data processing occurs locally in the browser
- No external network requests are made
- No user data is collected or transmitted
- Chrome's security model provides sandboxing

#### Potential Security Areas
While the extension is designed with security in mind, potential areas of concern include:
- DOM manipulation and injection
- Chrome extension permissions
- Cross-frame communication (iframe scenarios)
- Message passing between extension components

#### Safe Usage
The extension is designed to:
- Only operate on LinkedIn Queens pages
- Use minimal required permissions
- Process data locally without external transmission
- Follow Chrome extension security best practices

### 🏆 Recognition
Contributors who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in the fix release notes (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Listed in a security contributors section
- Given priority support for future security reports

### 📋 Security Best Practices

If you're contributing to the project, please follow these security guidelines:
- Validate all DOM interactions
- Use secure coding practices
- Avoid eval() or similar dynamic code execution
