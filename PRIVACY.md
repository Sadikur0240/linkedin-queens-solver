## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and:

1. **Detects LinkedIn Queens game pages** when you visit them
2. **Analyzes the game board** structure using DOM parsing
3. **Calculates puzzle solutions** using local algorithms
4. **Displays visual guidance** directly on the game page

All processing happens locally in your browser with no data leaving your device.
