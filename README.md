A Chrome extension that automatically solves the daily 'Queens' puzzle game on LinkedIn. It uses a modified backtracking algorithm to handle the game's unique constraints, including colored regions and queen adjacency rules, providing instant solutions with visual guidance directly on the LinkedIn game page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XaJason/linkedin-queens-solver.git
   ```

2. **Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`**

3. **Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top right corner**

4. **Click the "Load unpacked" button**

5. **Select the `/extensions` directory from the cloned project folder**

6. **Navigate to a LinkedIn Queens puzzle page and the extension will automatically solve the puzzle, displaying solutions in the console and highlighting positions on the board**

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The extension follows Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture with three core components working in harmony. The **Content Script** (`content.js`) handles DOM parsing and visual feedback, automatically detecting LinkedIn Queens game boards and extracting puzzle state including grid dimensions, color mappings, and existing queen placements. The **Background Script** (`background.js`) serves as the computational engine, implementing the optimized backtracking algorithm with auxiliary data structures for O(1) conflict checking. The **Popup Script** (`popup.js`) provides user interface controls and status information. Communication between components uses Chrome's secure message passing protocol, ensuring efficient data flow while maintaining the extension's security boundaries and respecting LinkedIn's game integrity.
