A Chrome extension that automatically solves the daily 'Queens' puzzle game on LinkedIn with **universal compatibility**. Works seamlessly for both **signed-in users** (direct DOM access) and **signed-out users** (iframe-based game loading). The extension uses an optimized backtracking algorithm to handle the game's unique constraints, including colored regions and queen adjacency rules, providing instant solutions with visual guidance directly on the LinkedIn game page.

## üöÄ Universal Compatibility

‚úÖ **Signed-In Users** - Direct game board access and immediate solving  
‚úÖ **Signed-Out Users** - Smart iframe detection and cross-frame puzzle solving  
‚úÖ **All LinkedIn Game Modes** - Automatically adapts to different LinkedIn game presentations  
‚úÖ **SPA Navigation** - Seamless operation across LinkedIn's single-page application routing

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The extension follows Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture with three core components working in harmony to provide **universal LinkedIn compatibility**. 

### Core Components:

- **Content Script** (`content.js`) - Features **intelligent context detection**, automatically identifying whether the game runs in direct DOM (signed-in users) or iframe mode (signed-out users). Handles DOM parsing, visual feedback, and cross-frame communication with sophisticated iframe detection algorithms.

- **Background Script** (`background.js`) - Serves as the computational engine, implementing the optimized backtracking algorithm with auxiliary data structures for O(1) conflict checking. Processes puzzle data regardless of source context (main page or iframe).

- **Popup Script** (`popup.js`) - Provides user interface controls and status information with context-aware feedback.

### Universal Compatibility Architecture:

The extension automatically detects LinkedIn's game loading strategy:
- **Direct Mode (Signed-In)**: Game board exists directly on main page DOM
- **Iframe Mode (Signed-Out)**: Game loads within `linkedin.com/games/view/queens/desktop` iframe

Communication flows through Chrome's secure message passing protocol, with the content script intelligently adapting to either context while maintaining full functionality and respecting LinkedIn's security boundaries.
